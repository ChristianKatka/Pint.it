## Project

This application was created as a group-project in 5 months time while being in
the Ticorporate-period. I was the main developer in this project so code included
in this repository is around 80% written by me.

The application is meant for people who want's to socialize with other people revolving around beer. In the application you can publish new posts, create and read
other people's comments and follow each and another.

Whole project is in cloud, so you can just download the application and you're ready
